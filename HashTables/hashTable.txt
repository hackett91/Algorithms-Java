Is a abstract data type
doesn't have to be a int
Key/value pairs - data types don't have to match
Optimized for  retrieval (when you now the key)
Assosciative array is one type of hash table

HASHING
hashing maps key of any type to an int
In Java, has function is Object.hasCode()
Collision occurs when more than one value has the same hashed value

LOAD FACTOR
Tells us how full a hash table is
Load factor = # of item/capacity = size/capacity
Load factor is used to decide when to resize the array backing the hash table
Don't want load factor too low
Don't want load factor too high
Can play a role in determining the time complexity for retrieval
